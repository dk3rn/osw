Openspot Widget

OSW is a little to remote control the (C)SharkRF Openspot.
It is esspecially useful, if you use a DMR radio, which has no promiscious mode.

The basic idea is to have a small window on your computer, which enables you to switch between TalkGroups (TGs) and reroute TGs
to TG9. By doing so, you can leave your DMR Radio on TG9 and work the TG you like.

Basically all this is also possible from the OpenSpot WebInterface, but we consider this more convinient.
E.g. OSW stays logged in in contrast to the Web interface, where you have to re-login after a specific time.

I hope it is useful to you
